        <h2>Helicopter</h2>
        <p class="indent">A helicopter is an aircraft that can take off and land vertically, hover, and fly forward,
            backward, and laterally. It achieves lift and thrust using rotating blades, allowing it to perform unique
            movements that airplanes cannot. Helicopters are commonly used for rescue missions, transport, and military
            operations.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>Plane</h2>
        <p class="indent">A plane, also known as an airplane or aeroplane, is a fixed-wing aircraft that uses forward
            motion to generate lift. Air flows over its wings, creating an upward force that allows it to stay in the
            air. Planes are efficient for long-distance travel and are widely used for commercial, cargo, and military
            purposes.</p>
